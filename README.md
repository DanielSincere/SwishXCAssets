# Create XCAssets

Render an App Icon for your iOS app from an SVG, in the accompanying XCAssets file structure.

## Usage

Import this into your [Swish](https://github.com/FullQueueDeveloper/Swish.git) scripts so you can `swish appicon` whenever you need to regenerate.

## Full example

The [ios-base](https://github.com/0xOpenBytes/ios-base) template app uses this library to generate an App Icon. An App Icon is needed to upload to TestFlight.
